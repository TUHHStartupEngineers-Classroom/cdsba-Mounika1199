Standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a measure of the average distance of data points from the mean.
Comparing standard deviations makes sense when the variables are on similar scales. Higher standard deviations indicate greater variability.

cov(random_vars)
cor(random_vars)

4.Correlation is often easier to interpret as it is scaled between -1 and 1, making it independent of the scale of the variables. It indicates the strength and direction of a linear relationship.
Covariance is in the units of the product of the two variables, making it sensitive to the scales.
