years <- 2002:2021
cage_movies <- c(5, 7, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40)
pool_drownings <- c(1200, 1180, 1150, 1120, 1100, 1080, 1060, 1040, 1020, 1000, 980, 960, 940, 920, 900, 880, 860, 840, 820, 800)

data <- data.frame(Year = years, CageMovies = cage_movies, PoolDrownings = pool_drownings)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data, aes(x = CageMovies, y = PoolDrownings)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Spurious Correlation: Nicholas Cage Movies vs Pool Drownings",
       x = "Number of Nicholas Cage Movies Released",
       y = "Number of Pool Drownings")
       


```

Although the plot may suggest a correlation between the number of Nicholas Cage movies released and the number of pool drownings, this is a spurious correlation. The variables are not causally related; there's likely a confounding factor or it's just a coincidence.
