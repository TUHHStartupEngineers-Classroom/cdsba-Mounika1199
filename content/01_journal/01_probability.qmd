            ASSIGNMENT 1

1.P(T∩S) = P(S) * P(T|S) = 0.3 * 0.2 = 0.06

2.P(T∩~S) = P(~S) * P(T|~S) = 0.7 * 0.6 = 0.42

3.P(~T∩S) = P(S) * P(~T|S) = 0.3 * 0.8 = 0.24

4.P(~T∩~S) = P(~S) * P(~T|~S) = 0.7 * 0.4 = 0.28

Total sum = 0.06 + 0.42 + 0.24 + 0.28 = 1



             ASSIGNMENT 2


1.What is the percentage of customers using all three devices?
-> 0.5%

2.What is the percentage of customers using at least two devices?
-> 7.3% + 8.8% + 3.3% + 0.5% = 19.9%

3.What is the percentage of customers using only one device?
-> 42.3% + 27.8% + 10% = 80.1%



              ASSIGNMENT 3
              
              
1. After computing the first probability the output is 0.01 * 0.96 / ((0.01 * 0.96) + (0.97 * 0.04)) = 0.1983

2. After computing the second probability the output is 0.97 * 0.04 / ((0.97 * 0.04) + (0.01 * 0.96)) = 0.802

These results show that in case the alarm is triggered, there is a possibility of about 19.8 % that the product is flawless and a probability of 80.2 % that the product is faulty.
