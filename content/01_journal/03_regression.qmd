1.The data type of peakrpm is numeric value.The coefficent estimate value of peakrpm is 2.526.
2.As peakrpm increases by 1 unit the dependent variable price increases by 2.526 units.As peakrpm decreases by 1 unit the dependent variable price decreases by 2.526 units.
3.The significant codes for peakrpm is '***' which indicates the p-value is less than 0.001, due to the very small value of p it indicates strong evidence against null hypothesis that the coefficient is equal to zero and is therefore highly significant.This interpretation leads to linear relationship between 'peakrpm' and the dependent variable 'price' and holds other variables constant.

summary(lm_all_modified)

The variable seat_heating has a coefficient value of 'NA'.The 'NA' or default value indicates missing or undefined data.
